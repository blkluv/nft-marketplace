#### NFT? ERC-721 tokens?

NFT stands for non-fungible tokens like ERC-721 (a smart contract standard) tokens which are hosted on Ethereum’s own blockchain. NFTs are unique digital items such as collectibles or artworks or game items. As an artist, by tokenizing your work you both ensure that it is unique and brand it as your work. The actual ownership is blockchain-managed.

#### What does “minting” mean?

The process of tokenizing your work and creating an NFT (see above).

#### Can I change the price of an already created NFT collectible?

Absolutely, you can lower the price free of transaction costs at any time. You just need to sign the signature request within your wallet.

#### What does “burn a token” mean?

The ERC-721 standard does not only allow the creation of NFTs, but also includes a possibility to destroy them - i.e. burning the token.

#### How do I join as an artist?

Artists can submit a profile to SuperRare using this form. https://forms.gle/xomZqftbZ5ShDc3B6 LUV NFT is still in early access and only a very small number of artists are being invited at the moment.

We've received an enormous influx of submissions and are currently unable to respond to all everyone who gets in touch. 

#### What is verification? 

Verified badges are granted to creators and collectors that show enough proof of authenticity and active dedication to the marketplace. We are looking at multiple factors such as active social media presence and following, dialogue with community members,number of minted and sold items.
